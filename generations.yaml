    description: "The Chevrolet Sonic (sold as the Aveo in some international markets) was a subcompact car that replaced the previous generation Aveo in North America. Available as both a four-door sedan and five-door hatchback, it featured significantly improved design, engineering, and quality compared to its predecessor. The exterior design was distinctively sporty with motorcycle-inspired headlights, hidden rear door handles on the hatchback, and an overall more aggressive stance than most subcompacts of its era. Powertrain options included a naturally aspirated 1.8L four-cylinder or a more modern 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder, the latter offering a good balance of performance and efficiency with 138 HP. Both five-speed manual and six-speed automatic transmissions were available. The interior featured a unique instrument cluster with a combination of digital and analog displays inspired by motorcycle gauges, and materials quality was improved over the previous Aveo. A significant refresh for the 2017 model year updated the exterior styling and added technology features including standard 7-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Special models included the sporty RS package with unique styling elements and the performance-oriented RS Turbo with sport-tuned suspension. Despite receiving generally positive reviews for its driving dynamics, practicality, and feature content, declining sales of small cars led to its discontinuation after the 2020 model year as GM shifted focus to crossovers and SUVs. The Sonic represented Chevrolet's most competitive small car offering in North America up to that point, helping to improve the brand's reputation in the segment."

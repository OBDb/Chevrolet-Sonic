    description: "The second-generation Aveo was introduced in 2011 and marketed as the Chevrolet Sonic in the Americas, Japan, Middle East, South Africa and several Southeast Asian markets. Based on the GM Gamma II global subcompact platform, the Sonic debuted at the 2010 Paris Motor Show and entered production on August 2, 2011, with first deliveries in October 2011. The exterior design was distinctively sporty with motorcycle-inspired headlights and an overall more aggressive stance than most subcompacts of its era. Powertrain options included a naturally aspirated 1.8L four-cylinder producing 135 HP or a 1.4L turbocharged four-cylinder producing 138 HP. Both five-speed manual and six-speed automatic transmissions were available. The interior featured a unique instrument cluster with motorcycle-inspired gauge design. The Sonic was notably the only car in its class assembled in America at the Orion Assembly plant in Michigan. This pre-facelift model was produced from 2012 to 2015."

    platform: "GM Gamma II"
    description: "At the 2016 New York International Auto Show, Chevrolet revealed the refreshed North American version of the Sonic hatchback and sedan. The facelift brought a restyled front fascia, new LED tail lights and refreshed equipment. The LTZ trim level was renamed Premier for the 2017 model year. The previous RS trim level became a standard appearance package for all hatchback models with unique upholstery, red interior accents, and unique aluminum-alloy wheels. The 1LS model was only available as a sedan following the refresh. Production continued until October 20, 2020, when the model was discontinued due to GM's plans to convert the Orion Assembly to EV production and declining sales in the small car segment."
